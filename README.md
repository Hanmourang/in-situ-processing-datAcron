# In-Situ Processing - datAcron

This is a component within the [datAcron EU](http://www.datacron-project.eu/) project.

This module aims to provide a Flink component that process a stream of raw messages
(i.e., AIS Dynamic Messages) and enrich it with derived attributes such as min/max, average and variance of original fields.

In addition, a stream simulator for the raw messages is developed in the context of this module, which provides a functionality to replay the original stream of raw messages by generating a simulated new Kafka Stream and taking into the account the time delay between two consecutive messages of a trajectory, furthermore, this delay can be scaled in/out by a configuration parameter.

# Output Description:
 * We use the same order of attributes in AIS messages of NARI source with adding addition attributes computed by this module as depicted in the following table:

| Attribute        | Data type           |Description  |
 | ------------- |:-------------:|:-----|
 |  id 	| integer          |A globally unique identifier for the moving object (usually, the MMSI of vessels).|
|  status 	|integer          |	Navigational status
|  turn 	|double   |	Rate of turn, right or left, 0 to 720 degrees per minute
|  speed 	|double  |	Speed over ground in knotsint (allowed values: 0-102.2 knots)
|  course 	|double   |	Course over ground (allowed values: 0-359.9 degrees)
|  heading 	|integer      	|	True heading in degrees (0-359), relative to true north
|  longitude 		|double   |	Longitude (georeference: WGS 1984)
| latitude 		|double  |	Latitude  (georeference: WGS 1984)
| timestamp 		|long            |   timestamp in UNIX epochs (i.e., milliseconds elapsed since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.000).

# Run on Flink (locally):
 * To run the **In-Situ Processing module** on Flink cluster (locally):
    * Go the root directory of the project.
    * Edit the 'scripts/runInSituOnFlinkLocally.sh' and update the correct local directory of the Flink installation for the `FLINK_DIR`  in the script.
    * Make sure that the script file has a permission to be executed, use 'chmod +x scripts/runInSituOnFlinkLocally.sh'.
    * Run the script by `./scripts/runInSituOnFlinkLocally.sh` that submit the In-Situ Processing job to the local Flink cluster.

 * To run the **Stream Simulator** component on Flink cluster (locally):
      * Go the root directory of the project.
      * Edit the 'scripts/runSimulatorOnFlinkLocally.sh' and update the correct local directory of the Flink installation for the `FLINK_DIR`  in the script.
      * Make sure that the script file has a permission to be executed, use 'chmod +x scripts/runSimulatorOnFlinkLocally.sh'.
      * Run the script by `./scripts/runSimulatorOnFlinkLocally.sh` that submit the Stream simulator job to the local Flink cluster.    

# Setup in development mode:
* To Setup the Kafka cluster locally, run a predefined shell script `scrips/setup-kafka.sh`
* To execute the simulator for the stream of raw messages, run `eu.datacron.in_situ_processing.streams.simulation.RawStreamSimulator`.
*  To execute the In-Situ Processing module:  `eu.datacron.in_situ_processing.InSituProcessingApp`.
* To check the module output run the `scrips/runOutputStreamKafkaConsumer.sh` that lunches a consumer console for the output stream of the module.
